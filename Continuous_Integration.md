# Continuous_Integration

Continuous Integration is the practice of integrating changes from different developers in the team into a mainline as early as possible, in best cases several times a day. This makes sure the code individual developers work on doesnâ€™t divert too much. When you combine the process with automated testing, continuous integration can enable your code to be dependable.
